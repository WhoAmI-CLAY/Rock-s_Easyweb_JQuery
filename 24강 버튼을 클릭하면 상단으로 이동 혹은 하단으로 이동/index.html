        Since last year, the Moon administration has carried out a broad campaign to stop leafleting and also enacted the anti-leaflet law, but the president has barely mentioned the topic in public. The rare mention of it in his 20-minute speech, according to experts, can be seen as an effort to stably manage the Korean Peninsula situation to prevent Pyongyang from engaging in provocation ahead of the crucial summit between the US and Korea, where the future policy direction toward the recalcitrant regime hangs in the balance.

        “If the Korean government responds to the leaflet-launch issue passively, it could provide a pretext for North Korea to take action that could aggravate inter-Korean relations. And as a result, there is a possibility that the current administration couldn’t do anything to (revive) inter-Korean ties until the term ends,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute.
        
        Cheong added that if inter-Korean relations worsen over the leaflet issue before Moon meets US President Joe Biden in Washington on May 21, it will further weaken the trust Washington has placed in Seoul concerning North Korean issues.
        
        The two leaders are to meet for their first summit talks, and North Korea is expected to top the agenda, as the US has just completed its monthslong policy review on the reclusive regime. 
        
        Moon, who is under a compressed timeline before his term ends next May, has set sights on the goal of achieving “irreversible peace” on the Korean Peninsula and is making last-ditch efforts to salvage his stalled diplomacy with the North.
        
        Many view the upcoming summit as a critical time where the allies will discuss and establish a consensus on how to deal with North Korea going forward. It could be Moon’s last chance to push the US to seek engagement with North Korea and kick-start stalled nuclear talks.
        
        Hong Min, a senior researcher at the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification, echoed a similar view and stressed that Moon’s remarks on the leaflet issue show his focus on preventing the situation on the peninsula from getting worse, rather than proposing new inter-Korean projects or other new ideas before the summit in Washington.
